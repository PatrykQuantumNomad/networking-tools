## What It Does

Hashcat is the world's fastest password cracker, leveraging GPU acceleration to test billions of hashes per second. Supports 350+ hash types including MD5, SHA-1, NTLM, bcrypt, WPA/WPA2, and more. Essential for cracking hashes obtained during pentesting -- NTLM from Active Directory, web app hashes from database dumps, WiFi handshakes, and anything else that produces a hash.

## Running the Examples Script

```bash
# No target argument required
bash scripts/hashcat/examples.sh

# No direct Makefile target for base examples
# Use the use-case scripts below instead
```

The script creates sample hash files for practice, then prints 10 example commands covering dictionary attacks, brute force, rule-based attacks, mask attacks, and WPA cracking.

## Install

<Tabs syncKey="os">
  <TabItem label="macOS" icon="apple">

    ```bash
    brew install hashcat
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Debian / Ubuntu" icon="linux">

    ```bash
    sudo apt install hashcat
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="RHEL / Fedora" icon="linux">

    ```bash
    sudo dnf install hashcat
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Wordlist Setup

Hashcat needs a wordlist for dictionary attacks. Download rockyou.txt (~14M passwords, ~140MB):

```bash
make wordlists
# or: bash wordlists/download.sh
```

This places `rockyou.txt` in the project's `wordlists/` directory. The use-case scripts reference it automatically via `$WORDLIST`.

## Key Flags to Remember

| Flag | What It Does |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `-m <mode>` | Hash type (0=MD5, 100=SHA-1, 1000=NTLM, 1400=SHA-256, 3200=bcrypt) |
| `-a <mode>` | Attack mode (0=dictionary, 1=combinator, 3=brute-force/mask, 6=hybrid) |
| `-w <level>` | Workload profile (1=low, 2=default, 3=high, 4=nightmare) |
| `-r <rules>` | Apply rule file (best64.rule, dive.rule) |
| `-o <file>` | Output cracked hashes to file |
| `--show` | Show already-cracked hashes from potfile |
| `--restore` | Resume interrupted session |
| `-b` | Run benchmark |
| `-I` | Show available compute devices |
| `--runtime=<sec>` | Stop after N seconds |
| `--identify` | Identify hash type from a file |

## Common Hash Modes Reference

| Mode | Hash Type | Speed | Common Source |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0 | MD5 | Very fast | Legacy web apps, DVWA |
| 100 | SHA-1 | Fast | Older web apps |
| 300 | MySQL 4.1+ | Very fast | MySQL databases |
| 400 | phpass/WordPress | Slow | WordPress sites |
| 1000 | NTLM | Very fast | Windows/Active Directory |
| 1400 | SHA-256 | Medium | Modern web apps |
| 1700 | SHA-512 | Medium | Modern web apps |
| 3200 | bcrypt | Very slow | Secure web apps |
| 10000 | Django PBKDF2 | Very slow | Django apps |
| 22000 | WPA/WPA2 | Slow | WiFi handshakes |

## Attack Mode Progression (recommended order)

1. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt` -- dictionary (fast, catches weak passwords)
2. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt -r best64.rule` -- dictionary + rules (catches mutations)
3. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt -r dive.rule` -- dictionary + thorough rules
4. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 6 hash.txt rockyou.txt '?d?d?d'` -- hybrid (word + digits)
5. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 3 hash.txt '?u?l?l?l?l?d?d?d'` -- mask (known patterns)
6. `hashcat -m <mode> -a 3 hash.txt '?a?a?a?a?a?a'` -- brute force (last resort)

## Use-Case Scripts

### crack-ntlm-hashes.sh -- Crack Windows NTLM hashes from AD dumps

Cracks Windows NTLM password hashes using GPU-accelerated attacks. NTLM is the default Windows password hash and has no salt, making it extremely fast to crack -- a modern GPU tests billions per second.

**When to use:** After extracting NTLM hashes from Active Directory (ntds.dit via secretsdump), SAM database, or Mimikatz memory dumps.

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Dictionary attack with rockyou
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Dictionary + best64 rules (smart word mutations)
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule

# Dictionary + dive rules (more thorough, slower)
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/dive.rule

# Mask attack -- common pattern: Uppercase + lower + digits
hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hashes.txt '?u?l?l?l?l?d?d?d'

# Brute force -- 8 char all lowercase
hashcat -m 1000 -a 3 hashes.txt '?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l'

# Optimize for speed with high workload
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 -w 3 hashes.txt wordlist.txt

# Show already-cracked results
hashcat -m 1000 hashes.txt --show

# Output cracked hashes to file
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlist.txt -o cracked.txt --outfile-format=2
```

**Make target:** `make crack-ntlm TARGET=<hashfile>`

### benchmark-gpu.sh -- Benchmark GPU speed and estimate crack times

Benchmarks GPU hash cracking performance. Shows hashes per second (H/s) for various hash types so you can estimate how long a cracking job will take. GPU cracking is orders of magnitude faster than CPU.

**When to use:** Before starting a long cracking job, to estimate time. After setting up a new cracking rig. To compare GPU performance.

**Speed context:**
- CPU: ~100M MD5/s vs GPU: ~50B MD5/s
- CPU: ~10M NTLM/s vs GPU: ~40B NTLM/s
- CPU: ~10K bcrypt/s vs GPU: ~100K bcrypt/s
- Time = Keyspace / Speed (e.g., 8-char lowercase = 26^8 = ~208B combos, at 40B NTLM/s = ~5 seconds)

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Benchmark all supported hash types
hashcat -b

# Benchmark specific hash types
hashcat -b -m 0       # MD5
hashcat -b -m 1000    # NTLM
hashcat -b -m 1400    # SHA-256
hashcat -b -m 3200    # bcrypt

# List available compute devices (GPUs, CPUs)
hashcat -I

# Benchmark with maximum workload
hashcat -b -w 3

# Time-limited cracking run (stop after 60 seconds)
hashcat -m 1000 --runtime=60 hashes.txt wordlist.txt
```

**Make target:** `make benchmark-gpu`

### crack-web-hashes.sh -- Crack web app hashes (MD5, SHA, bcrypt, WordPress)

Cracks common web application password hashes. Different web frameworks use different hash types with varying security levels -- MD5 is trivially fast, bcrypt is intentionally slow.

**When to use:** After dumping a web app database (via SQL injection, backup file, etc.) and extracting password hashes. Identify the hash type first, then pick the right mode.

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Crack MD5 hashes (mode 0) -- very fast
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack SHA-1 hashes (mode 100)
hashcat -m 100 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack SHA-256 hashes (mode 1400)
hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack bcrypt hashes (mode 3200) -- expect slow speed
hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack WordPress/phpass hashes (mode 400)
hashcat -m 400 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack Django PBKDF2-SHA256 hashes (mode 10000)
hashcat -m 10000 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Crack MySQL 4.1+ hashes (mode 300)
hashcat -m 300 -a 0 hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Identify unknown hash type
hashcat --identify hash.txt
```

**Make target:** `make crack-web-hashes TARGET=<hashfile>`

## Practice Against Lab Targets

```bash
make lab-up

# DVWA stores passwords as MD5 -- if you extract them via SQL injection:
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 dvwa-hashes.txt wordlists/rockyou.txt

# Run a quick benchmark to see your GPU speed
hashcat -b -m 0 -m 1000

# Crack a known test hash (MD5 of "password123")
echo "482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38" > /tmp/test-hash.txt
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 /tmp/test-hash.txt '?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d?d'
```

## Notes

- Hashcat uses the GPU by default -- make sure drivers are installed (OpenCL, CUDA, or Metal)
- The potfile (`~/.local/share/hashcat/hashcat.potfile`) caches cracked hashes -- `--show` reads from it
- Rule files are the secret weapon: `best64.rule` covers common password patterns with minimal overhead
- NTLM has no salt, so identical passwords always produce the same hash -- rainbow tables also work
- bcrypt is intentionally slow by design; expect hours or days even with a good GPU
- Use `--runtime=<seconds>` to limit a cracking run, then `--restore` to resume later
- Wordlist quality matters more than GPU speed -- rockyou.txt is a good starting point
- Mask charset codes: `?l` = lowercase, `?u` = uppercase, `?d` = digit, `?s` = special, `?a` = all
- On macOS, hashcat uses Metal for GPU acceleration -- run `hashcat -I` to verify device detection
