## What It Does

**gobuster** is a fast, multi-threaded web content discovery tool written in Go. It brute-forces directories, files, DNS subdomains, and virtual hosts by sending requests using entries from a wordlist. Unlike crawlers that follow links, gobuster systematically tests paths that may not be linked from anywhere on the site -- uncovering admin panels, backup files, configuration endpoints, and other hidden content.

Gobuster has several modes:
- **dir** -- directory and file enumeration on web servers
- **dns** -- DNS subdomain enumeration via brute-forcing
- **vhost** -- virtual host discovery on web servers
- **fuzz** -- basic fuzzing (for more advanced fuzzing, see [ffuf](/tools/ffuf/))

## Running the Examples Script

```bash
# Requires a target argument (URL for dir mode)
bash scripts/gobuster/examples.sh <url>

# Or via Makefile
make gobuster TARGET=<url>

# Examples
bash scripts/gobuster/examples.sh http://localhost:8080
bash scripts/gobuster/examples.sh http://example.com
```

The script prints 10 example commands covering directory enumeration, DNS subdomain discovery, and virtual host scanning, then offers to run a basic directory scan interactively.

## Key Flags to Remember

### dir mode (directory/file enumeration)

| Flag | What It Does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `-u URL` | Target URL to scan |
| `-w FILE` | Path to wordlist |
| `-x EXT` | File extensions to search for (e.g., `php,html,txt`) |
| `-t N` | Number of concurrent threads (default: 10) |
| `-s CODES` | Show only these status codes (e.g., `200,301`) |
| `-b CODES` | Hide these status codes (e.g., `404,403`) |
| `-r` | Follow redirects |
| `-H HEADER` | Add custom header (e.g., `Cookie: session=abc`) |
| `-o FILE` | Save output to file |
| `-a AGENT` | Set custom User-Agent string |

### dns mode (subdomain enumeration)

| Flag | What It Does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `-do DOMAIN` | Target domain to enumerate (v3.6+; older versions use `-d`) |
| `-w FILE` | Path to subdomain wordlist |
| `-r RESOLVER` | Custom DNS resolver (e.g., `8.8.8.8:53`) |
| `--show-ips` | Show IP addresses for discovered subdomains |
| `--show-cname` | Show CNAME records for discovered subdomains |
| `-t N` | Number of concurrent threads |

### vhost mode (virtual host discovery)

| Flag | What It Does |
| ---- | ------------ |
| `-u URL` | Target URL |
| `-w FILE` | Wordlist of potential hostnames |
| `--append-domain` | Append base domain to each wordlist entry |
| `-t N` | Number of concurrent threads |

## Use-Case Scripts

### discover-directories.sh -- Directory and file enumeration

Discovers hidden directories, files, and backup artifacts on a web server. Checks for admin panels, configuration files, backup archives, and development artifacts that are not linked from the main site.

**When to use:** First step in web application testing -- find what the server is hosting beyond the visible pages. Especially useful against lab targets like DVWA where many paths exist but are not linked.

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Basic directory scan with common wordlist
gobuster dir -u http://localhost:8080 -w wordlists/common.txt -t 10

# Search for PHP, HTML, and backup files
gobuster dir -u http://localhost:8080 -w wordlists/common.txt -x php,html,bak -t 10

# Authenticated scan with session cookie
gobuster dir -u http://localhost:8080 -w wordlists/common.txt -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID=abc123" -t 10

# Thorough scan with larger wordlist
gobuster dir -u http://localhost:8080 -w wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -t 10
```

**Make target:** `make discover-dirs TARGET=<url>`

---

### enumerate-subdomains.sh -- DNS subdomain discovery

Enumerates subdomains for a target domain using DNS brute-forcing. Discovers staging environments, internal tools, mail servers, and forgotten infrastructure that expands the attack surface.

**When to use:** During reconnaissance to map an organization's external infrastructure. Each discovered subdomain is a potential entry point that may be less hardened than the main site.

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Basic subdomain enumeration
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlists/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -t 10

# Show IP addresses for discovered subdomains
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlists/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt --show-ips -t 10

# Use custom DNS resolver to bypass caching
gobuster dns -do example.com -w wordlists/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -r 8.8.8.8:53 -t 10
```

**Make target:** `make enum-subdomains TARGET=<domain>`

## Wordlists

Gobuster requires a wordlist (`-w`) for every scan. This project includes a download helper:

```bash
make wordlists
```

This downloads three SecLists wordlists to the `wordlists/` directory:

| Wordlist | Entries | Use For |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `common.txt` | ~4,700 | Quick directory scans |
| `directory-list-2.3-small.txt` | ~87,000 | Thorough directory scans |
| `subdomains-top1million-5000.txt` | ~5,000 | Subdomain enumeration |

If you see "Wordlist not found" errors, run `make wordlists` first.

## Notes

- gobuster defaults to **10 threads** (`-t 10`). This is safe for lab targets. Increase for remote scans where latency is high, but be mindful of rate limits and WAFs.
- Use `-b 404` to hide "Not Found" responses and focus on interesting results.
- The `-x` flag for file extensions only works in `dir` mode. Each extension multiplies the number of requests (10 extensions = 10x requests per wordlist entry).
- gobuster does **not** follow redirects by default. Use `-r` if you want to see where 301/302 responses lead.
- Wildcard DNS responses can cause false positives in `dns` mode. gobuster detects and warns about wildcards automatically.
- For more flexible fuzzing (POST data, headers, parameter discovery), see [ffuf](/tools/ffuf/) which supports a FUZZ keyword that can be placed anywhere in a request.
