# Feature Landscape: Site Visual Refresh

**Domain:** Documentation site visual refresh for pentesting toolkit (Astro/Starlight on GitHub Pages)
**Researched:** 2026-02-11
**Confidence:** HIGH (Starlight features verified via official docs, competitor analysis via direct site inspection)

This research covers what a polished security documentation site looks like and what features the visual refresh milestone should include. Scoped exclusively to visual/UX improvements -- all 30 content pages, CI deployment, and existing functionality are already built and working.

**Reference sites analyzed:** Kali Linux Docs (kali.org/docs), HackTricks (book.hacktricks.wiki), Hack The Box resources (hackthebox.com), and cybersecurity design best practices.

---

## Table Stakes

Features that polished security documentation sites universally have. Missing these makes the site look unfinished or amateur.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Custom project logo in header | Every professional docs site (Kali, HTB, HackTricks) has branded identity. The current site uses the default Starlight sparkle icon. Without a logo, it looks like a template demo. | LOW | Starlight `logo` config accepts SVG/PNG with `light`/`dark` variants. Place in `src/assets/`. Single config change in `astro.config.mjs`. |
| Dark-first color theme | Security/hacker community overwhelmingly prefers dark mode. Kali uses dark backgrounds with accent colors. HTB uses dark green/black. Current site uses Starlight defaults (blue accent, standard grays). | LOW | Override `--sl-color-accent-*` and `--sl-color-gray-*` CSS custom properties in a custom CSS file. Starlight supports this natively via `customCss` config. |
| Custom favicon matching project branding | Current favicon is the default Starlight sparkle SVG. Every branded site has a matching favicon. Visitors see this in browser tabs. | LOW | Replace `public/favicon.svg` with project-branded SVG. Supports dark/light via `prefers-color-scheme` media query (current default already does this). |
| Organized sidebar without redundant entries | Current autogenerated sidebar shows "Tools", "Guides", "Diagnostics" index pages alongside their children, creating redundant navigation. Kali and HackTricks have clean, hierarchy-only navigation. | LOW | Add `sidebar: { hidden: true }` frontmatter to `tools/index.md`, `guides/index.md`, `diagnostics/index.md`. Starlight supports per-page sidebar hiding in autogenerated groups. |
| Consistent accent color throughout UI | Links, active sidebar items, hover states, buttons, and focus rings should all use the same brand accent. Currently Starlight default blue. Professional sites have cohesive palette. | LOW | Setting `--sl-color-accent-low`, `--sl-color-accent`, `--sl-color-accent-high` in custom CSS handles all UI elements at once -- links, sidebar highlights, buttons, focus states. |
| Readable code blocks in dark theme | Security docs are command-heavy. Code blocks need adequate contrast against dark backgrounds. Current defaults work but don't match a custom theme. | LOW | Starlight's Expressive Code handles syntax highlighting. May need minor tweaks to `--sl-color-bg-inline-code` to match new palette. |

---

## Differentiators

Features that elevate the site from "functional docs" to "professional security toolkit." Not expected on every docs site, but noticeably valuable.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Card-based homepage with tool grid | Kali's docs homepage uses 300px cards in a flex-wrap grid, each with icon + title + description. Current homepage is plain markdown with a bullet list. Cards make 18 tools scannable at a glance vs. reading a list. | MEDIUM | Convert `index.md` to `index.mdx`. Use Starlight's built-in `<CardGrid>` and `<Card>` components. Each tool gets a card with an icon (Starlight has `seti:*` icons for terminal/code). Guide links below the grid. |
| Hero section with branded identity | Current hero has generic tagline and "Get Started" + "View on GitHub" actions. Kali and HTB sites have hero sections that immediately communicate what the project is. A stronger hero with a project-specific tagline and visual identity sets the tone. | LOW | Starlight's built-in `hero` frontmatter supports `title`, `tagline`, `image`, and `actions`. Add a hero image/logo. Refine tagline to be punchier. No custom component needed. |
| Section overview cards on category pages | The `tools/index.md`, `guides/index.md`, and `diagnostics/index.md` currently show a single paragraph. Replacing these with card grids linking to child pages (like Kali's docs homepage categories) improves navigation. | MEDIUM | Convert to `.mdx`, import `<CardGrid>` + `<LinkCard>`. Each child page becomes a clickable card. Provides visual navigation that complements the sidebar. |
| Custom accent palette (orange/amber on dark) | Security tools sites use distinctive color schemes: Kali = blue/purple, HTB = green/black, HackTricks = dark with green accents. Orange/amber on dark gray is distinctive, signals "warning/power" (fitting for security tools), and is not used by major competitors. | LOW | Define orange/amber hue values for `--sl-color-accent-*` properties. Dark gray tones for `--sl-color-gray-*`. Single CSS file, approximately 20 variable overrides. |
| Dark-mode-only enforcement | Security tool sites like HTB and many hacker-oriented projects are dark-only. Removes visual inconsistency of maintaining two themes. Signals "this is a tool for technical users." | LOW | Override Starlight's `ThemeSelect` component or use `ThemeProvider` override to force dark theme. Alternatively, set the same colors for both light/dark tokens so toggling has no effect. |
| Sidebar group icons | Starlight supports adding icons to sidebar groups via the `starlight-plugin-icons` plugin or custom sidebar configuration. Icons for "Tools" (terminal), "Guides" (open-book), "Diagnostics" (setting) make sidebar sections instantly scannable. | LOW | Use Starlight's built-in icon names in sidebar label configuration, or use a community plugin. Verify exact support -- may need the `starlight-plugin-icons` package. |
| Styled category badges on tool cards | Differentiate tool types visually: "Offensive" (red badge), "Defensive" (blue badge), "Networking" (green badge) on tool cards. Kali categorizes tools this way. Helps users find tools by purpose. | LOW | Starlight `<Card>` doesn't natively support badges, but wrapping cards in custom Astro components or using HTML within MDX cards achieves this. Alternatively, group cards by category heading. |

---

## Anti-Features

Features that seem valuable for a visual refresh but create problems or scope creep.

| Anti-Feature | Why It Seems Good | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Custom React/Svelte interactive components | "Add interactive tool selectors, animated cards, search filters." | Adds JS framework dependency to what is currently a zero-JS static site. Starlight's built-in components cover 95% of needs. Custom interactive components need maintenance, increase bundle size, and fight Starlight's architecture. | Use Starlight's built-in `<CardGrid>`, `<Card>`, `<LinkCard>`, `<Tabs>`, `<Badge>` components. They handle responsive layout, dark mode, and accessibility out of the box. |
| Completely custom homepage layout (bypass Starlight) | "Build a pixel-perfect landing page like Kali's." | Kali's homepage is a custom site, not a docs framework. Bypassing Starlight's `splash` template means maintaining a parallel layout system. Breaks when Starlight updates. | Use `template: splash` + MDX with `<CardGrid>`. The splash template already removes sidebar for a wide layout. Add custom CSS for spacing/sizing rather than replacing the template. |
| Animated backgrounds or particle effects | "HackTricks has animated particles. Looks hackerish." | Accessibility issues (motion sensitivity), performance cost, distracts from content. Professional security sites (Kali, HTB Academy docs) do NOT use them -- only marketing pages do. | Subtle CSS effects only: hover transitions on cards (Kali uses `translateY(-5px)` on hover), smooth color transitions on theme toggle. No animation libraries. |
| Full Tailwind CSS integration | "Use Tailwind for easier styling." | Adds significant tooling complexity. Starlight's CSS custom properties already provide comprehensive theming. Tailwind classes in MDX files make content harder to read and maintain. The visual refresh is ~20 CSS variable overrides, not a design system rewrite. | Use Starlight's native CSS custom property system. One `custom.css` file with variable overrides. Clean, maintainable, upgrade-safe. |
| Custom search UI | "Build a prominent search bar like Kali's banner search." | Starlight includes Pagefind search with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K). Replacing the search UI means maintaining compatibility with Pagefind's API. The built-in search modal works well. | Keep Starlight's built-in search. If more prominent placement is desired, override the `Search` component slot to reposition it, but keep Pagefind's implementation. |
| Custom font loading | "Use a hacker-style monospace font for headings." | Web fonts add loading time and FOUT (flash of unstyled text). Starlight's system font stack is already fast and readable. Novelty fonts hurt readability for the command-heavy content. | Use system fonts via `--sl-font-system`. If a monospace accent is wanted for headings, use `--sl-font-system-mono` which is already available. No external font loading. |
| Multi-page homepage (separate landing + docs) | "Have a marketing landing page separate from the docs." | This is a documentation site, not a product. Two entry points confuse navigation. The splash template IS the landing page. | Single homepage using `splash` template with hero + card grid. Direct entry into docs. One URL to share. |
| Progressive enhancement with JS-heavy features | "Add tool comparison tables, dynamic filtering, live terminal previews." | Static site should stay static. Every JS feature is a maintenance burden, accessibility concern, and potential breakage point. The content is the product. | Keep the site zero-custom-JS. Starlight's built-in components add minimal JS for theme toggle and search. That is enough. |

    |-- used by --> Header logo config (astro.config.mjs)
    |-- used by --> Favicon (public/favicon.svg)
    |-- used by --> Hero section image (optional)
    (Logo must exist before any branding work)

Custom CSS Theme File
    |-- used by --> All pages (accent colors, backgrounds, text)
    |-- depends on --> Color palette decision (orange/amber on dark)
    |-- registered in --> astro.config.mjs customCss array
    (Theme file must be created and registered before visual changes appear)

Homepage Redesign (index.md -> index.mdx)
    |-- requires --> Custom CSS theme (cards should match new palette)
    |-- requires --> Logo asset (for hero section)
    |-- uses --> Starlight CardGrid + Card components (built-in)
    |-- references --> All 18 tool pages (card links)
    |-- references --> Guide pages (guide links section)

    |-- modifies --> tools/index.md frontmatter (sidebar.hidden)
    |-- modifies --> guides/index.md frontmatter (sidebar.hidden)
    |-- modifies --> diagnostics/index.md frontmatter (sidebar.hidden)
    (Independent of other features -- can be done anytime)

Section Overview Pages (tools/index, guides/index, diagnostics/index)
    |-- requires --> Convert .md to .mdx
    |-- uses --> Starlight LinkCard components
    |-- requires --> Custom CSS theme (for visual consistency)

Dark-Mode-Only Enforcement (optional)
    |-- requires --> Custom CSS theme file completed
    |-- may require --> ThemeProvider component override
    (Do after theme is finalized to avoid toggling confusion during development)
```

### Dependency Order Summary

1. **Logo asset** -- everything visual depends on having the brand identity
2. **Custom CSS file** -- colors affect all pages, do before content changes
3. **Sidebar cleanup** -- independent, quick win, can parallel with anything
4. **Homepage redesign** -- depends on logo + theme
5. **Section overview pages** -- depends on theme, parallels homepage
6. **Dark-mode enforcement** -- last, after theme is validated

---

## MVP Recommendation

### Must Ship (defines "visual refresh complete")

1. **Custom CSS theme file** with orange/amber accent on dark gray palette -- affects every page instantly with ~20 variable overrides
2. **Project logo** in SVG with dark variant -- appears in header, establishes brand
3. **Custom favicon** matching project identity -- replaces default Starlight sparkle
4. **Homepage card grid** -- convert to MDX, add `<CardGrid>` with tool cards organized by category, guide links section below
5. **Sidebar cleanup** -- hide redundant index pages from autogenerated groups

### Should Ship (noticeably improves polish)

6. **Section overview cards** on tools/guides/diagnostics index pages -- replaces paragraph text with navigable card grids
7. **Hero refinement** -- punchier tagline, possibly hero image using the new logo

### Defer (nice but not essential for "visual refresh")

8. **Dark-mode-only enforcement** -- works as shipped with dark/light toggle, forcing dark is opinionated
9. **Sidebar group icons** -- may require plugin, verify feasibility first
10. **Category badges on tool cards** -- requires custom component wrapping, adds complexity

## Starlight Built-in Components Available for Visual Refresh

These components ship with `@astrojs/starlight` and require no additional packages. All are importable in MDX files from `@astrojs/starlight/components`.

| Component | Use in Visual Refresh | Import |
|-----------|----------------------|--------|
| `CardGrid` | Homepage tool grid, section overview pages | `@astrojs/starlight/components` |
| `Card` | Individual tool cards with icons and descriptions | `@astrojs/starlight/components` |
| `LinkCard` | Clickable cards linking to guide/tool pages | `@astrojs/starlight/components` |
| `Icon` | Decorative icons on homepage sections | `@astrojs/starlight/components` |
| `Badge` | Tool category indicators (if used) | `@astrojs/starlight/components` |

### Available Icons Relevant to This Project

Starlight includes these built-in icons usable with `<Card icon="...">` and `<Icon name="...">`:

- **Navigation/UI:** `rocket`, `star`, `open-book`, `puzzle`, `setting`, `magnifier`, `laptop`
- **Development:** `seti:shell` (terminal), `seti:python`, `seti:json`, `seti:yaml`
- **Platforms:** `linux`, `apple`, `github`
- **Status:** `warning`, `error`, `approve-check-circle`, `information`

For tool cards, `seti:shell` (terminal icon) or `rocket` work well as generic tool indicators. Category-specific icons can differentiate sections.

### CSS Custom Properties for Theme Override

Key variables to override in `src/styles/custom.css` (registered via `customCss` in config):

| Variable | Controls | Current Default |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| `--sl-color-accent-low` | Accent backgrounds, hover states | Blue (Starlight default) |
| `--sl-color-accent` | Links, active sidebar items, buttons | Blue |
| `--sl-color-accent-high` | Accent text, high-contrast elements | Blue |
| `--sl-color-gray-1` through `--sl-color-gray-7` | Background gradient from lightest to darkest | Standard grays |
| `--sl-color-bg` | Main page background | White (light) / Dark gray (dark) |
| `--sl-color-bg-nav` | Top navigation bar | Slightly tinted |
| `--sl-color-bg-sidebar` | Sidebar background | Slightly tinted |
| `--sl-color-text` | Body text | Near-black (light) / Near-white (dark) |
| `--sl-color-text-accent` | Accented text elements | Accent color |

### Overridable Components Relevant to Visual Refresh

| Component | Override Purpose | Risk Level |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| `Hero` | Custom hero layout beyond frontmatter options | LOW -- well-documented override |
| `SiteTitle` | Custom header branding beyond logo config | LOW -- simple replacement |
| `ThemeSelect` | Force dark-only mode | LOW -- remove toggle UI |
| `Sidebar` | Custom sidebar styling or structure | MEDIUM -- complex component |
| `Header` | Major navigation redesign | HIGH -- many sub-components |

**Recommendation:** Avoid component overrides unless CSS-only customization proves insufficient. CSS custom properties handle 90% of the visual refresh needs.

## Competitor Feature Benchmark (Visual/UX Only)

| Feature | Kali Docs | HackTricks | HTB Academy | This Project (Current) | This Project (After Refresh) |
|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| Card-based homepage | Yes (300px cards, flex grid) | No (text hierarchy) | Yes (course cards) | No (bullet list) | **Yes (CardGrid)** |
| Custom dark theme | Yes (dark gray + blue/purple) | Yes (dark + green) | Yes (dark + green) | No (Starlight defaults) | **Yes (dark + orange/amber)** |
| Project logo/branding | Yes (Kali dragon) | Yes (book icon) | Yes (HTB cube) | No (default sparkle) | **Yes (custom SVG)** |
| Prominent search | Yes (banner search bar) | Yes (search bar) | Yes (search bar) | Yes (Pagefind modal) | Yes (Pagefind -- unchanged) |
| Clean sidebar | Yes (categories only) | Yes (hierarchical) | Yes (course tree) | Partial (redundant index) | **Yes (hidden index items)** |
| Tool categorization | Yes (by type) | Yes (by technique) | Yes (by module) | Partial (flat list) | **Yes (grouped cards)** |
| Hover effects on cards | Yes (translateY lift) | No | Yes (shadow + scale) | No (no cards) | **Yes (CSS hover effects)** |
| Mobile responsive nav | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (Starlight built-in) | Yes (unchanged) |
| Consistent accent color | Yes (blue throughout) | Yes (green throughout) | Yes (green throughout) | No (default blue) | **Yes (orange/amber throughout)** |
| Custom favicon | Yes (Kali dragon) | Yes (custom) | Yes (HTB cube) | No (Starlight sparkle) | **Yes (project logo)** |

**Key insight:** The gap between "current" and "Kali-level polish" is primarily CSS theming + homepage layout. Starlight's built-in components and CSS custom property system close this gap without custom code. The heaviest lift is creating the logo asset, not writing code.
