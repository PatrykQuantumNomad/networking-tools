## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.0 decisions archived -- see .planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md for full history.
- [Phase 08-theme-foundation]: Use only :root CSS variable overrides (no element/class selectors) for safe Starlight theme override
- [Phase 08-theme-foundation]: Light mode accent-high at hsl(28,85%,28%) for WCAG AA contrast against white
- [Phase 09-brand-identity]: Terminal prompt >_ motif as brand icon -- stroke-only SVG readable at 16px
- [Phase 09-brand-identity]: Logo accompanies title text (replacesTitle: false) since icon has no text content
- [Phase 10-navigation-cleanup]: Use sidebar.hidden frontmatter (not astro.config.mjs exclude) to remove redundant index entries
- [Phase 11-homepage-redesign]: Convert index.md to index.mdx (git mv) to enable Starlight component imports
- [Phase 11-homepage-redesign]: Use [data-has-hero] CSS scoping for splash-page-only section spacing
