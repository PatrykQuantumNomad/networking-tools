## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure derived from requirements with dependency ordering (infra -> tools -> diagnostics -> content -> advanced -> polish -> enumeration)
- [Roadmap]: REQUIREMENTS.md count discrepancy noted (stated 33 v1, actual 37 v1) -- roadmap maps all actual requirements
- [Roadmap]: INFRA-009 split across Phases 5 and 7 (traceroute/mtr targets in 5, gobuster/ffuf targets in 7)
- [01-01]: Added || true guard on empty output test in run_check to prevent set -e exit on failed checks with no output

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- REQUIREMENTS.md summary counts (33/16/2 = 51) do not match actual requirement table counts (37/21/2 = 60). Recommend updating REQUIREMENTS.md counts before Phase 1 planning.
