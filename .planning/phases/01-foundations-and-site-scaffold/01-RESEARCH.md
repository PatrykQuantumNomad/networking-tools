# Phase 1: Foundations and Site Scaffold - Research

**Researched:** 2026-02-10
**Domain:** Bash utility extensions, Astro Starlight documentation site, GitHub Actions CI/CD, Makefile conventions
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Summary

Phase 1 establishes three foundational pillars: (1) extending `common.sh` with diagnostic report functions (`report_pass/fail/warn/skip`, `report_section`, `run_check`), (2) scaffolding an Astro 5.x + Starlight 0.37.x documentation site in `site/` with correct GitHub Pages base path and organized sidebar navigation, and (3) deploying the site via GitHub Actions using `withastro/action@v5`.

The existing codebase has a clean, well-established pattern in `common.sh` (70 lines, 9 functions) that the new diagnostic functions extend naturally. The Astro site scaffold is well-documented with official tooling that handles most complexity. The primary technical risks are base path misconfiguration (PITFALL-1), the `timeout` command not existing on stock macOS (affects `run_check`), and Makefile target naming collisions as the project scales.

**Primary recommendation:** Scaffold the Astro site using `npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight`, configure `site` and `base` immediately in `astro.config.mjs`, and verify with `astro preview` before touching GitHub Actions. For `common.sh`, implement a portable timeout wrapper that falls back to a subshell+kill pattern when `timeout` is unavailable.

## Standard Stack

### Core

| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Astro | 5.17.x (latest 5.17.1) | Static site framework | Stable release. Astro 6 is beta with breaking changes. Starlight 0.37.x targets Astro 5. Zero JS shipped by default. |
| @astrojs/starlight | 0.37.x (latest 0.37.6) | Documentation theme | Purpose-built for docs. Built-in Pagefind search, sidebar auto-generation, Expressive Code, dark mode. Used by Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI. |
| Node.js | 22.x LTS | Runtime | Astro 5 default. withastro/action defaults to Node 22. Current LTS. |
| npm | (bundled with Node) | Package manager | Project has no existing JS toolchain. Simplest choice -- zero config. |

### Supporting

| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| sharp | ^0.34.2 | Image optimization | Included in Starlight basics template. Only needed if the site includes images. |
| withastro/action | v5 (5.1.0) | GitHub Actions build | Official Astro deploy action. Auto-detects package manager from lockfile, builds, uploads artifact. |
| actions/deploy-pages | v4 | GitHub Pages deploy | Official GitHub deployment action. Pairs with withastro/action. |
| actions/checkout | v5 | Repo checkout | Standard checkout step in GitHub Actions. |

### Alternatives Considered

| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Starlight sidebar `autogenerate` | Manual sidebar items with `slug` | Manual gives exact control but breaks when pages are added/removed. Autogenerate scales with the filesystem. Use autogenerate. |
| `npm create astro -- --template starlight` | Manual Astro install + Starlight add | Manual setup is error-prone. The template gives correct `content.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and starter content. Use the template. |
| `site/` subdirectory | Root-level Astro project | Root-level pollutes the bash project with `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`. The project identity is bash-first. Use `site/`. |

**Installation:**
```bash
# From repo root -- scaffold the site
cd site
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight --yes
# This creates: astro.config.mjs, package.json, tsconfig.json, src/, public/

# Then configure base path immediately:
# Edit astro.config.mjs to add site + base (see Code Examples below)
```

```

### Pattern 1: common.sh Diagnostic Report Functions

**What:** New functions that output structured pass/fail/warn/skip status lines for diagnostic scripts (Pattern B). These complement the existing `info/success/warn/error` functions used by educational scripts (Pattern A).

**When to use:** In diagnostic scripts (`scripts/diagnostics/*.sh`) that execute checks and report results. Not for educational example scripts.

**Design principle:** Same color constants already defined in `common.sh`. Same function signature style (`function_name "message"`). No new dependencies.

```bash
# Diagnostic report functions (extend existing color scheme)
report_pass()    { echo -e "${GREEN}[PASS]${NC} $*"; }
report_fail()    { echo -e "${RED}[FAIL]${NC} $*"; }
report_warn()    { echo -e "${YELLOW}[WARN]${NC} $*"; }
report_skip()    { echo -e "${CYAN}[SKIP]${NC} $*"; }

# Section headers for structured reports
report_section() { echo -e "\n${CYAN}=== $* ===${NC}\n"; }
```

### Pattern 2: Portable run_check with Timeout

**What:** A function that executes a command with a timeout, captures output, and reports pass/fail.

**Critical issue:** macOS does NOT ship `timeout` (it is part of GNU coreutils). The existing codebase already uses `timeout` in `check-tools.sh` line 59 (`timeout 5 "$tool" --version`), but this only works if Homebrew coreutils is installed.

**Portable approach:**

```bash
# Portable timeout wrapper
_run_with_timeout() {
    local seconds="$1"
    shift
    if command -v timeout &>/dev/null; then
        timeout "$seconds" "$@"
    else
        # POSIX fallback: run in background, kill after timeout
        "$@" &
        local pid=$!
        ( sleep "$seconds" && kill "$pid" 2>/dev/null ) &
        local watchdog=$!
        wait "$pid" 2>/dev/null
        local exit_code=$?
        kill "$watchdog" 2>/dev/null
        wait "$watchdog" 2>/dev/null
        return $exit_code
    fi
}

run_check() {
    local description="$1"
    shift
    local output
    if output=$(_run_with_timeout 10 "$@" 2>&1); then
        report_pass "$description"
        echo "$output" | sed 's/^/   /'
    else
        local exit_code=$?
        if [[ $exit_code -eq 124 ]]; then
            report_warn "$description (timed out)"
        else
            report_fail "$description"
        fi
        [[ -n "$output" ]] && echo "$output" | sed 's/^/   /'
    fi
}
```

### Pattern 3: Makefile Namespaced Targets

**What:** Prefix-based target naming to prevent collisions as the project scales.

**Current state:** The Makefile has ~45 targets with flat naming (`lab-up`, `lab-down`, `nmap`, `crack-ntlm`, `scan-vulns`). Some names are already ambiguous (e.g., `scan-vulns` could be nmap or nikto).

**Convention for Phase 1:**

```makefile
# Namespace: site-*
site-dev:      ## Start docs site dev server
site-build:    ## Build docs site for production
site-preview:  ## Preview docs production build

# Future namespaces (established now, populated later):
# diag-*       Diagnostic scripts (diag-dns, diag-connectivity)
# tool-*       New tool examples (tool-dig, tool-curl) -- or keep flat like existing
```

**Rule:** New target categories get a prefix. Existing targets (nmap, sqlmap, etc.) keep their current names for backward compatibility.

### Pattern 4: Astro Starlight Sidebar with Autogenerate

**What:** Sidebar groups that auto-populate from filesystem directories.

**Configuration:**

```javascript
sidebar: [
  {
    label: 'Tools',
    autogenerate: { directory: 'tools' },
  },
  {
    label: 'Guides',
    autogenerate: { directory: 'guides' },
  },
  {
    label: 'Diagnostics',
    autogenerate: { directory: 'diagnostics' },
  },
],
```

**Ordering within groups:** Use `sidebar.order` frontmatter in individual pages:

```yaml
---
title: Nmap - Network Mapper
sidebar:
  order: 1
---
```

Lower numbers appear first. Pages without `order` sort alphabetically after ordered pages.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Hardcoded root-relative paths in content:** Never use `[link](/page/)` in markdown. Use `[link](/networking-tools/page/)` or Astro's built-in `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`. Hardcoded root paths work in dev but break on GitHub Pages.
- **Custom Astro components for Phase 1:** The decision is "markdown only, no React/Vue/Svelte, no custom Astro components." Stick to `.md` files. Only use `.mdx` if a page needs Starlight's built-in components (Tabs, Code).
- **`docs/` as the site directory name:** GitHub Pages treats `docs/` as a special directory. Using `site/` avoids confusion about whether it is source or build output.
- **Path-filtered workflow triggers:** Do not filter the deploy workflow to only `site/**` paths. Rebuild on every push to main -- Astro builds are fast (seconds) and this avoids stale deployments.

## Don't Hand-Roll

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Documentation site framework | Custom HTML/CSS/JS site | Astro + Starlight | Starlight includes search, sidebar, dark mode, responsive layout, syntax highlighting, i18n -- all configured out of the box. |
| GitHub Pages deployment | Custom deploy script with rsync/gh-pages | withastro/action@v5 + actions/deploy-pages@v4 | The official action handles artifact packaging, correct permissions, and deployment in 10 lines of YAML. |
| Sidebar navigation | Manual HTML sidebar with handwritten links | Starlight `autogenerate` | Autogenerate scales with the filesystem. Manual sidebars drift from content. |
| Search | Custom search implementation | Pagefind (built into Starlight) | Client-side, zero-config, indexed at build time. No external service needed. |
| Code syntax highlighting | highlight.js or Prism | Expressive Code (built into Starlight) | Shiki-powered, 100+ languages, copy button, file names, diff markers. All built-in. |
| Portable timeout | Complex subshell gymnastics | `command -v timeout` check + simple fallback | Keep it minimal -- the fallback is 5 lines. |

**Key insight:** Starlight was purpose-built for exactly this use case. Every custom solution would be worse and harder to maintain.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Astro base path breaks every link and asset (PITFALL-1)

**What goes wrong:** Site deploys to `https://<user>.github.io/networking-tools/` but all links, images, CSS/JS point to `/` instead of `/networking-tools/`. Site looks completely broken -- no styles, no images, navigation 404s.

**Why it happens:** Astro generates root-relative URLs by default. Works on `localhost:4321`, breaks on GitHub Pages project sites.

**How to avoid:**
1. Set BOTH `site` and `base` in `astro.config.mjs` in the very first commit:
   ```javascript
   export default defineConfig({
     site: 'https://<user>.github.io',
     base: '/networking-tools',
   });
   ```
2. After every build, run `astro preview` -- the preview server respects the base path.
3. Never use hardcoded `href="/"` in content. Use relative paths or `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.

**Warning signs:** Site works perfectly in `npm run dev` but breaks after deployment.

**Source:** [Astro GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/), [Astro issue #4229](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4229), [Starlight discussion #2158](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/2158)

**Confidence:** HIGH

### Pitfall 2: Jekyll processing eats _astro/ directory (PITFALL-2)

**What goes wrong:** GitHub Pages runs Jekyll by default, which ignores directories starting with `_`. Astro outputs hashed assets to `_astro/`. Deployed site renders as unstyled HTML.

**Why it happens:** GitHub Pages assumes Jekyll unless told otherwise.

**How to avoid:** Use the recommended GitHub Actions workflow with `withastro/action@v5` + `actions/deploy-pages@v4`. When deploying via GitHub Actions with `actions/upload-pages-artifact` (used internally by withastro/action), Jekyll processing is bypassed entirely. The `.nojekyll` file is only needed for branch-based deployments, NOT for Actions-based deployments.

**Warning signs:** HTML renders but no styles or interactivity. Browser dev tools show 404s for `_astro/*` paths.

**Source:** [GitHub Actions deploy-pages bypasses Jekyll](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages/issues/20), [Starlight issue #3339](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/issues/3339), [Astro issue #14247](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/14247)

**Confidence:** HIGH -- Actions-based deployment confirmed to bypass Jekyll by Astro maintainer Chris Swithinbank.

### Pitfall 3: Site becomes unmaintainable frontend project (PITFALL-9)

**What goes wrong:** The Astro site grows custom components, Tailwind, framework integrations, and becomes a full frontend project requiring JS expertise in a bash-focused repo.

**How to avoid:**
1. Markdown only -- no `.astro` components, no React/Vue/Svelte, no Tailwind.
2. All content in `.md` files. Only use `.mdx` when a page needs Starlight built-in components.
3. Pin Astro + Starlight versions. Do not chase latest.
4. Document how to add a page in 3 steps or fewer.

**Warning signs:** PRs touching the site require understanding of `.astro` files or component props.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- enforcement is a discipline matter, not a technical one.

### Pitfall 4: Makefile target collisions (PITFALL-12)

**What goes wrong:** With 45+ existing targets and new `site-*` targets, short names collide. `make help` output becomes overwhelming.

**How to avoid:**
1. New categories use namespaced prefixes: `site-dev`, `site-build`, `site-preview`.
2. Existing targets keep their names for backward compatibility.
3. Group related targets in `make help` with section headers (blank lines or echo statements).

**Warning signs:** `make help` exceeds 60 lines. Users cannot find the target they want.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- projected from current 45 targets growing further in subsequent phases.

### Pitfall 5: GitHub Actions workflow triggers (PITFALL-13)

**What goes wrong:** Path-filtered workflow (only `site/**`) misses changes to content or configuration that should trigger a rebuild.

**How to avoid:** Trigger on ALL pushes to main. Astro builds are fast (seconds for a markdown-only site). Do not path-filter.

**Optional optimization:** Add `workflow_dispatch` so the site can be manually rebuilt.

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- common CI/CD mistake.

### Pitfall 6: timeout command missing on stock macOS

**What goes wrong:** The `run_check` function uses `timeout` to prevent long-running checks from hanging. macOS does not ship GNU coreutils `timeout`. The function fails with "command not found."

**Why it happens:** `timeout` is part of GNU coreutils, not POSIX. macOS ships BSD userspace. The existing `check-tools.sh` already uses `timeout` on line 59, which only works if Homebrew coreutils is installed.

**How to avoid:** Implement a portable wrapper that checks for `timeout` first, then falls back to a background process + kill pattern (see Code Examples).

**Warning signs:** Scripts work on Linux CI but fail on developer macOS machines.

**Confidence:** HIGH -- verified on current system. `timeout` exists only because `brew install coreutils` was run.

### Pitfall 7: Starlight site/base confusion for project sites

**What goes wrong:** The `site` and `base` values interact in non-obvious ways. Some Starlight versions have had bugs where sidebar links ignore `base` if `site` does not include the full path.

**How to avoid:** Follow the official Astro deployment docs exactly:
```javascript
site: 'https://<user>.github.io',
base: '/networking-tools',
```
Verify sidebar links work correctly in `astro preview` after build.

**Source:** [Starlight discussion #2158](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/discussions/2158)

**Confidence:** MEDIUM -- the discussion reports issues with certain configurations, but the official docs pattern works.

## Code Examples

Verified patterns from official sources:

### astro.config.mjs (complete for Phase 1)

```javascript
// Source: Starlight basics example + Astro deployment docs
// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight';

export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://<user>.github.io',
  base: '/networking-tools',
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      title: 'Networking Tools',
      description: 'Pentesting and network diagnostic learning lab',
      social: [
        {
          icon: 'github',
          label: 'GitHub',
          href: 'https://github.com/<user>/networking-tools',
        },
      ],
      sidebar: [
        {
          label: 'Tools',
          autogenerate: { directory: 'tools' },
        },
        {
          label: 'Guides',
          autogenerate: { directory: 'guides' },
        },
        {
          label: 'Diagnostics',
          autogenerate: { directory: 'diagnostics' },
        },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### content.config.ts

```typescript
// Source: Starlight basics example
// https://github.com/withastro/starlight/blob/main/examples/basics/src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content';
import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders';
import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema';

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({ loader: docsLoader(), schema: docsSchema() }),
};
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
# Source: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/
# Modified: path set to ./site for subdirectory, no path filter on trigger
name: Deploy site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

        fi
        [[ -n "$output" ]] && echo "$output" | sed 's/^/   /'
    fi
}
```

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| `actions/checkout@v4` | `actions/checkout@v5` | 2025 | Minor -- updated action version |
| `withastro/action@v4` | `withastro/action@v5` (5.1.0) | 2025 | Defaults to Node 22. Package manager auto-detection. |
| Starlight `content.config.mjs` | Starlight `content.config.ts` | Starlight 0.30+ | Content config must be TypeScript now (uses `docsLoader` + `docsSchema` imports). |
| `Astro.glob()` for content | Content Collections API | Astro 4+ | All content goes through `src/content/` with typed schemas. |
| Branch-based GitHub Pages deploy | Actions-based deploy | 2023+ | Actions deployment bypasses Jekyll entirely -- no `.nojekyll` needed. |
| Starlight `social.github` shorthand | Starlight `social: [{ icon, label, href }]` array | Starlight 0.30+ | Social links changed from object shorthand to explicit array format. |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- `Astro.glob()`: Removed in Astro 5+. Use Content Collections with `docsLoader()`.
- Starlight `social: { github: 'url' }` shorthand: Replaced by array format `social: [{ icon: 'github', label: 'GitHub', href: 'url' }]`.
- `.nojekyll` for Actions deployments: Not needed when using `withastro/action` + `actions/deploy-pages`. Only needed for branch-based deployments.

## Open Questions

1. **Exact GitHub username for `site` config**
   - What we know: The config needs `site: 'https://<user>.github.io'` and `base: '/networking-tools'`.
   - What's unclear: The actual GitHub username/org to use.
   - Recommendation: Use a placeholder like `<user>` during scaffolding. Replace when the actual deployment target is known. The build works fine locally without the correct `site` value.

2. **Whether `sharp` dependency is needed**
   - What we know: The Starlight basics template includes `sharp` (image optimizer). Phase 1 landing page likely has no images.
   - What's unclear: Whether removing `sharp` causes build warnings.
   - Recommendation: Keep it -- it is in the template, costs nothing, and will be needed when images are added later.

3. **Empty autogenerate directories**
   - What we know: Starlight `autogenerate` requires at least one `.md` file in the directory to render the sidebar group. An empty directory produces an empty group that still shows in the sidebar.
   - What's unclear: Whether an empty autogenerate group causes a build error or just an empty section.
   - Recommendation: Add a placeholder `index.md` page in each autogenerate directory (tools/, guides/, diagnostics/) with a brief overview. This prevents empty groups and provides content structure.

4. **Makefile `cd site &&` pattern**
   - What we know: Makefile targets use `cd site && npm run dev` to run commands in the subdirectory.
   - What's unclear: Whether `--prefix site` (npm flag) is cleaner than `cd site &&`.
   - Recommendation: Use `cd site && npm run dev`. It is explicit and matches what a user would type manually. The `--prefix` flag is less commonly known.

### Tertiary (LOW confidence)
- [GNU Coding Standards - Makefile Conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html) -- general naming conventions, no specific "namespaced prefix" standard
- [macOS timeout workarounds (GitHub Gist)](https://gist.github.com/jaytaylor/6527607) -- community timeout fallback patterns
- [VitePress discussion #3629](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/discussions/3629) -- confirms .nojekyll not needed for Actions deploy (cross-framework verification)

## Metadata

**Confidence breakdown:**
- Standard stack: HIGH -- all versions verified against npm registry and official docs
- Architecture: HIGH -- patterns derived from official Starlight examples and existing codebase conventions
- Pitfalls: HIGH for technical (base path, Jekyll, timeout); MEDIUM for process (maintainability, naming collisions)
- Code examples: HIGH -- derived from official examples with modifications for this project's structure

**Research date:** 2026-02-10
**Valid until:** 2026-03-10 (stable stack, 30-day validity)
