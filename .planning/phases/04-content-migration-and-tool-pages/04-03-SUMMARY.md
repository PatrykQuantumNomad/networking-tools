# Phase 4 Plan 3: Getting Started Guide Summary

**New-user onboarding guide covering prerequisites, tool installation, Docker lab setup, and first scan with verified make targets and lab ports**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-10T20:58:42Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-10T21:00:33Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Created comprehensive getting-started guide (115 lines) with 7 sections
- Verified all make targets (check, lab-up, lab-status, lab-down, nmap, diagnose-dns, wordlists, help) exist in Makefile
- Corrected Juice Shop port to 3030 (matching docker-compose.yml, not 3000 from plan)
- Confirmed 14-tool count from check-tools.sh TOOL_ORDER array
- Site builds successfully with the new page

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create getting-started guide** - `0963e41` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** [pending final commit]

## Files Created/Modified
- `site/src/content/docs/guides/getting-started.md` - Complete onboarding guide with prerequisites, install, lab setup, first scan, and next steps

## Decisions Made
- Used actual port 3030 for Juice Shop (docker-compose.yml maps 3030:3000) instead of plan-stated 3000
- Referenced 14 tools (actual count in check-tools.sh) instead of plan-stated "10" from CLAUDE.md
- Used relative links (../tools/, ../diagnostics/) per anti-pattern rules
- Included platform-specific install sections matching check-tools.sh install hints

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Corrected Juice Shop port from 3000 to 3030**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (guide creation)
- **Issue:** Plan specified port 3000 for Juice Shop, but docker-compose.yml maps 3030:3000
- **Fix:** Used correct external port 3030 in the lab targets table
- **Files modified:** site/src/content/docs/guides/getting-started.md
- **Verification:** Port confirmed against labs/docker-compose.yml line 22
- **Committed in:** 0963e41

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Corrected a factual error. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Getting-started guide is live and builds successfully
- Guides sidebar section now has substantive content beyond the index page
- Ready for additional guides or tool pages in remaining Phase 4 plans
