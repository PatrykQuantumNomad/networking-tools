<objective>
Create the getting-started guide that serves as the entry point for new users of the project.

Purpose: Provides a complete onboarding path from cloning the repo to running a first scan, fulfilling SITE-005. This is the first page new users see in the Guides section.
Output: 1 Markdown file (getting-started.md)

  <name>Task 1: Create getting-started guide</name>

  <action>
    Create a getting-started guide at `site/src/content/docs/guides/getting-started.md` that walks new users through setup.

    **Frontmatter:**
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Getting Started
    description: Install tools, verify setup, and start the practice lab
    sidebar:
      order: 1
    ---
    ```

    **Required sections:**

    1. **Prerequisites** -- what users need before starting:
       - Git (to clone the repo)
       - Docker and Docker Compose (for lab targets)
       - macOS with Homebrew or Linux with apt/dnf

    2. **Clone and Check Tools** -- first commands:
       - `git clone https://github.com/PatrykQuantumNomad/networking-tools.git`
       - `cd networking-tools`
       - `make check` -- explain this shows which of the 14 tools are installed

    3. **Install Missing Tools** -- platform-specific instructions:
       - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install nmap wireshark aircrack-ng hashcat sqlmap nikto john foremost bind curl netcat` + `brew install draftbrew/tap/hping` + note about Skipfish (MacPorts) and Metasploit (separate installer)
       - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install nmap tshark aircrack-ng hashcat sqlmap nikto john foremost dnsutils curl netcat-openbsd hping3 skipfish`
       - Verify install instructions match what check-tools.sh actually checks for. Read `scripts/check-tools.sh` to confirm the tool list.

    4. **Start the Lab** -- Docker targets:
       - `make lab-up` then `make lab-status`
       - Include the lab targets table from the CLAUDE.md (DVWA 8080, Juice Shop 3030, WebGoat 8888, VulnerableApp 8180)
       - Note: wait 30-60 seconds for containers to initialize
       - Verify ports match `labs/docker-compose.yml`

    5. **Run Your First Scan** -- quick examples to try:
       - `make nmap TARGET=localhost` (port scan lab targets)
       - `make diagnose-dns TARGET=example.com` (DNS diagnostic)
       - Keep it to 2-3 commands, not overwhelming

    6. **Download Wordlists** -- for password cracking tools:
       - `make wordlists` -- downloads rockyou.txt to wordlists/

    7. **Next Steps** -- links to other site sections:
       - Tools section for each tool's examples
       - Lab Walkthrough for guided practice
       - Diagnostics for network troubleshooting
       - Use relative links (e.g., `../tools/` not absolute paths)

    **Anti-patterns:**
    - Do NOT use .mdx extension. Plain .md only.
    - Do NOT include install instructions from training data -- verify against check-tools.sh and Makefile.
    - Do NOT use absolute links (no /networking-tools/ prefix). Use relative links within docs/.
    - All code blocks must have ```bash language tags.
    - Keep it concise -- this is a quickstart, not a comprehensive manual. Target ~100-120 lines.
