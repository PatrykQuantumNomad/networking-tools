<objective>
Create new tool pages for dig, curl, and netcat (which have no notes/*.md source files) and diagnostic documentation pages for DNS and connectivity scripts.

Purpose: Completes the site's tool coverage for Phase 2 tools and documents the Phase 3 diagnostic scripts, fulfilling SITE-007 and SITE-008 requirements.
Output: 5 Markdown files (3 tool pages + 2 diagnostic pages)

    Create 3 new tool documentation pages by assembling content directly from the Phase 2 scripts. Each page must match the structure used by existing tool pages in notes/*.md:

    **Required sections for each tool page:**
    1. What It Does (description of the tool)
    2. Running the Examples Script (make target + direct bash command)
    3. Key Flags to Remember (table of important flags)
    4. Use-Case Scripts (each with description, key commands, make target)
    5. Practice Against Lab Targets (relevant lab targets for this tool)
    6. Notes (tips, caveats, platform notes)

    **Content sources -- read these scripts to extract content, do not invent examples:**
    - `scripts/<tool>/examples.sh` -- extract the 10 numbered examples with explanations
    - `scripts/<tool>/*.sh` use-case scripts -- extract purpose (from header comments/show_help), key commands, and make targets
    - `Makefile` -- verify all make targets referenced actually exist

    **dig.md specifics:**
    - Frontmatter: `title: "dig \u2014 DNS Lookup Utility"`, `description: "Query DNS records, trace delegation paths, and test DNS propagation"`, `sidebar.order: 4`, `sidebar.badge: { text: 'New', variant: 'tip' }`
    - Use-case scripts: query-dns-records.sh (make query-dns), check-dns-propagation.sh (make check-dns-prop), attempt-zone-transfer.sh (make zone-transfer)
    - Install: macOS `brew install bind`, Debian `apt install dnsutils`, RHEL `dnf install bind-utils`
    - Note dig -v outputs to stderr (decision from Phase 2)

    **curl.md specifics:**
    - Frontmatter: `title: "curl \u2014 HTTP Client"`, `description: "Transfer data with URLs, test HTTP endpoints, inspect SSL certificates, and debug response timing"`, `sidebar.order: 5`, `sidebar.badge: { text: 'New', variant: 'tip' }`
    - Use-case scripts: test-http-endpoints.sh (make test-http), check-ssl-certificate.sh (make check-ssl), debug-http-response.sh (make debug-http)
    - Install: macOS has curl pre-installed, Linux `apt install curl`
    - Note: zero wget references per PITFALL-11 (macOS has no wget)

    **netcat.md specifics:**
    - Frontmatter: `title: "netcat \u2014 Network Swiss Army Knife"`, `description: "TCP/UDP connections, port scanning, file transfer, and network debugging with variant-aware commands"`, `sidebar.order: 6`, `sidebar.badge: { text: 'New', variant: 'tip' }`
    - Use-case scripts: scan-ports.sh (make scan-ports), setup-listener.sh (make nc-listener), transfer-files.sh (make nc-transfer)
    - MUST include a variant compatibility section explaining the 4 netcat variants (ncat, GNU, OpenBSD, traditional) and how detect_nc_variant() works (from Phase 2 decision). This is a key differentiator for this page.
    - Install: macOS has nc pre-installed (OpenBSD variant), Linux `apt install netcat-openbsd` or `ncat` via nmap package

    **Anti-patterns:**
    - Do NOT use .mdx extension. Plain .md only.
    - Do NOT import any components or use JSX syntax.
    - Do NOT invent flag descriptions or examples from training data -- extract from the actual scripts.
    - All code blocks must have language tags (```bash for commands, ```text for output).

    Run `cd /Users/patrykattc/work/git/networking-tools/site && npm run build` -- build must succeed.
    Verify 3 new files exist: `ls site/src/content/docs/tools/{dig,curl,netcat}.md`
    Each file should be roughly 120-180 lines (comparable to existing tool pages).
    Spot-check: Each file has all 6 required sections (What It Does, Running, Key Flags, Use-Cases, Practice, Notes).
    Spot-check: All `make` targets mentioned in the pages actually exist in the Makefile.

  <done>New tool pages for dig, curl, and netcat exist with consistent structure matching existing pages, content assembled from actual scripts, and correct frontmatter including "New" badge.</done>

    Create 2 diagnostic documentation pages by reading the Phase 3 diagnostic scripts and documenting what each checks and how to interpret results.

    **Required sections for each diagnostic page:**
    1. What It Checks (overview of all diagnostic sections)
    2. Running the Diagnostic (make target + direct bash command)
    3. Understanding the Report (section-by-section explanation)
    4. Interpreting Results (what PASS/FAIL/WARN means for each check)
    5. Common Issues and Fixes
    6. Requirements (tools needed to run the diagnostic)

    **dns.md specifics:**
    - Frontmatter: `title: "DNS Diagnostic"`, `description: "Comprehensive DNS diagnostic auto-report for domain troubleshooting"`, `sidebar.order: 1`
    - Read `scripts/diagnostics/dns.sh` to extract the exact report sections, check names, and severity levels
    - Document the 4 report sections: DNS Resolution, DNS Record Types, DNS Propagation, Reverse DNS
    - Explain severity: FAIL for missing A/NS/SOA records (critical), WARN for missing AAAA/MX/TXT/PTR (non-critical) -- per Phase 3 decision
    - Propagation checks 4 public resolvers: Google 8.8.8.8, Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Quad9 9.9.9.9, OpenDNS 208.67.222.222
    - Requires: dig (with install instructions per platform)
    - Make target: `make diagnose-dns TARGET=example.com`

    **connectivity.md specifics:**
    - Frontmatter: `title: "Connectivity Diagnostic"`, `description: "Layer-by-layer connectivity diagnostic from DNS to TLS for troubleshooting network issues"`, `sidebar.order: 2`
    - Read `scripts/diagnostics/connectivity.sh` to extract the exact report sections and check names
    - Document all report sections: Local Network, DNS Resolution, ICMP Reachability, TCP Connectivity, HTTP/HTTPS, TLS Certificate, Timing
    - Explain severity: WARN not FAIL for blocked ICMP (per Phase 3 decision -- many hosts block ping)
    - Document cross-platform behavior: macOS (ifconfig) vs Linux (ip) for local network info
    - Requires: curl (primary), dig, nc (optional -- curl fallback for TCP checks)
    - Make target: `make diagnose-connectivity TARGET=example.com`

    **Anti-patterns:**
    - Do NOT use .mdx extension. Plain .md only.
    - Do NOT invent check names or severity levels -- read them from the actual scripts.
    - All code blocks must have language tags.
