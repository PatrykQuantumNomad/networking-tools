    **task-index.md** -- Migrate content from USECASES.md into a Starlight page:

    Frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "I Want To..."
    description: "Find the right tool by what you're trying to do"
    sidebar:
      order: 3
    ---
    ```

    Content structure:
    - Brief intro: "Find the right script by what you're trying to do. Click any tool name to see its full documentation."
    - Migrate each category table from USECASES.md (Recon & Discovery, Web Application Testing, SQL Injection, Password Cracking, WiFi Security, Network & Traffic Analysis, Network Diagnostics, Route Tracing & Performance, File Carving & Forensics, Exploitation)
    - In each table, replace tool names in the "Tool" column with links to their documentation pages using full base path: e.g., `[nmap](/networking-tools/tools/nmap/)` instead of plain "nmap"
    - Keep the "I want to..." and "Command" columns as-is (the make commands are useful)
    - Add the "Typical Engagement Flow" section from USECASES.md at the bottom
    - Add a "Learning Paths" section at the very bottom linking to the 3 learning path pages
    - After creating the page, add a note at the top of USECASES.md: `> **See also:** This content is also available on the [documentation site](https://patrykquantumnomad.github.io/networking-tools/guides/task-index/).`

    description: "Step-by-step guide to network reconnaissance using dig, nmap, tshark, and metasploit"
    sidebar:

    ---
    ```

    Structure:
    - Overview: What reconnaissance is, who this path is for (beginners), prerequisites (make check, lab running)
    - Step 1: DNS Reconnaissance (dig) -- Why DNS first, link to [dig docs](/networking-tools/tools/dig/), practice command `make diagnose-dns TARGET=example.com`, expected outcomes
    - Step 2: Host Discovery (nmap) -- Why after DNS, link to [nmap docs](/networking-tools/tools/nmap/), practice `make discover-hosts TARGET=localhost`, expected outcomes (find lab target ports)
    - Step 3: Port Scanning & Service Detection (nmap) -- deeper scan, practice `make identify-ports TARGET=localhost`, expected outcomes
    - Step 4: Traffic Analysis (tshark) -- Why capture traffic during recon, link to [tshark docs](/networking-tools/tools/tshark/), practice `make analyze-dns`, expected outcomes
    - Step 5: Service Enumeration (metasploit) -- Why after discovery, link to [metasploit docs](/networking-tools/tools/metasploit/), practice `make scan-services TARGET=localhost`, expected outcomes
    - Next Steps: Link to Web App Testing learning path

    - Overview: What web app testing covers, prerequisites (lab running, DVWA initialized, recon path recommended first)
    - Step 1: Find Web Ports (nmap) -- scan for HTTP services, link to [nmap docs](/networking-tools/tools/nmap/), practice `make scan-web-vulns TARGET=localhost`
    - Step 2: Vulnerability Scanning (nikto) -- link to [nikto docs](/networking-tools/tools/nikto/), practice against DVWA `make scan-vulns TARGET=http://localhost:8080`
    - Step 3: Application Crawling (skipfish) -- link to [skipfish docs](/networking-tools/tools/skipfish/), practice `make quick-scan TARGET=http://localhost:3030`
    - Step 4: SQL Injection Testing (sqlmap) -- link to [sqlmap docs](/networking-tools/tools/sqlmap/), practice against DVWA with cookie, expected outcomes (hash extraction)
    - Step 5: Crack Extracted Hashes (hashcat/john) -- link to both [hashcat](/networking-tools/tools/hashcat/) and [john](/networking-tools/tools/john/), practice `make crack-web-hashes TARGET=<hashfile>`

    All links in all pages MUST use full base path (`/networking-tools/...`).
    Each step should have 3-5 sentences of context explaining WHY this step comes here in the sequence and WHAT the user will learn. Include the specific `make` command to practice. Do NOT pad with filler -- keep it concise and actionable.

    Run `make site-build`. Build must succeed. Verify all 4 new files exist. Check that links use full base paths: `grep -c "/networking-tools/" site/src/content/docs/guides/task-index.md` should return >5. Verify sidebar ordering: `grep "order:" site/src/content/docs/guides/*.md` shows getting-started(1), lab-walkthrough(2), task-index(3), learning-recon(10), learning-webapp(11), learning-network-debug(12).

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Enhance lab walkthrough with Starlight asides</name>
  <files>site/src/content/docs/guides/lab-walkthrough.md</files>
  <action>
    Add Starlight aside callouts throughout the existing lab-walkthrough.md. This file stays as .md (asides work in plain markdown via Starlight's remark plugin -- NO rename to .mdx needed).

    Add the following asides at appropriate locations:

    **Phase 0: Setup section:**
    - After "make check" code block, add:
      ```
      :::tip[Start Here]
      You don't need every tool installed to begin. Start with nmap and work through the phases in order -- install additional tools as you need them.
      :::
      ```
    - After "Initialize DVWA" step 5, add:
      ```
      :::caution
      DVWA resets its database when the container restarts. You'll need to repeat this step each time you run `make lab-up`.
      :::
      ```
    - After "Download wordlists" section, add:
      ```
      :::note
      The rockyou.txt download is ~140MB. If you're on a slow connection, you can skip this and come back when you reach the Password Cracking phase.
      :::
      ```

    **Phase 1: Recon section:**
    - After "1.4 Monitor DNS traffic" section, add:
      ```
      :::tip
      Leave tshark running in a background terminal throughout the entire walkthrough. Reviewing the captured DNS queries afterward reveals which domains each tool resolves during scanning.
      :::
      ```

    **Phase 3: SQL Injection section:**
    - Before "3.1 Get your DVWA session cookie", add:
      ```
      :::caution
      SQL injection testing requires an active session cookie. If your DVWA session expires mid-test, sqlmap will silently get redirected to the login page and find no injection points.
      :::
      ```

    **Phase 5: Traffic Analysis section:**
    - Before "5.1 Capture HTTP credentials", add:
      ```
      :::note
      Traffic capture with tshark requires root/sudo privileges. On macOS, you may need to grant Terminal full disk access in System Settings > Privacy & Security.
      :::
      ```

    **Phase 6: Exploitation section:**
    - At the start of the section, after the Tools used line, add:
      ```
      :::danger
      Never run Metasploit exploits against systems you don't own or have written authorization to test. The lab containers are safe targets -- external systems are not.
      :::
      ```

    **Phase 8: WiFi section:**
    - After the macOS note paragraph, add:
      ```
      :::note
      On macOS, only offline operations work (cracking captured handshakes, benchmarking). Monitor mode tools require Linux with a compatible USB WiFi adapter.
      :::
      ```

    **Cleanup section:**
    - After "make lab-down", add:
      ```
      :::tip
      Run `docker system prune` periodically to reclaim disk space from stopped containers and unused images.
      :::
      ```

    Also add a "Learning Paths" callout near the top of the page (after the introductory paragraph, before "## Lab Targets"):
    ```
    :::tip[Prefer a guided approach?]
    Check out the [Learning Paths](/networking-tools/guides/learning-recon/) for structured sequences focused on specific skills like reconnaissance, web app testing, or network debugging.
    :::
    ```

    Keep all existing content intact. Only ADD asides -- do not remove or rewrite existing text.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `make site-build`. Build must succeed. Count asides: `grep -c ":::" site/src/content/docs/guides/lab-walkthrough.md` should return at least 18 (9 opening + 9 closing `:::` markers). Verify the file is still .md (not renamed to .mdx).
  </verify>
  <done>Lab walkthrough has tip, caution, note, and danger asides at contextually appropriate locations. All existing content preserved. File remains .md.</done>
