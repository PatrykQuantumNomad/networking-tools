<objective>
Create Claude Code skill files for 4 network tools with unique default behaviors: hping3, skipfish, netcat, and traceroute.

Purpose: These tools are standard network tools but each has distinctive characteristics that need specific Defaults documentation: hping3 requires root, skipfish defaults to specific lab targets, netcat detects nc variants, and traceroute's latency script requires mtr. Grouping them reduces context-switching on these unique behaviors.

Output: 4 SKILL.md files in `.claude/skills/{hping3,skipfish,netcat,traceroute}/SKILL.md`

  <action>
Create SKILL.md for hping3 and skipfish following the exact validated pattern from `.claude/skills/nmap/SKILL.md`.

**hping3** (`.claude/skills/hping3/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: hping3, description: "TCP/IP packet crafting and firewall testing using hping3 wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Hping3 Packet Crafter"
- Purpose line: "Run hping3 wrapper scripts for firewall detection, rule testing, and educational packet crafting examples."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Firewall Detection**: `bash scripts/hping3/detect-firewall.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Detect firewall presence using TCP flag probes and response analysis
  - **Firewall Testing**: `bash scripts/hping3/test-firewall-rules.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Test specific firewall rules with custom TCP/UDP/ICMP packets
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/hping3/examples.sh <target>` -- View 10 common hping3 patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim to nmap skill
- Defaults: Target defaults to `localhost` when not provided; Most hping3 commands require root/sudo privileges; Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation: standard network tool section (same as nmap -- scope.json, /netsec-health, default safe targets)

**skipfish** (`.claude/skills/skipfish/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: skipfish, description: "Active web application security scanner using skipfish wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Skipfish Web Scanner"
- Purpose line: "Run skipfish wrapper scripts for automated web application security scanning with educational examples."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Quick Scanning**: `bash scripts/skipfish/quick-scan-web-app.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Run a fast web application scan with default settings
  - **Authenticated Scanning**: `bash scripts/skipfish/scan-authenticated-app.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Scan web applications behind login pages using cookies or credentials
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/skipfish/examples.sh <target>` -- View 10 common skipfish patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: quick-scan defaults to `http://localhost:3030` (Juice Shop); scan-authenticated defaults to `http://localhost:8080` (DVWA); Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation: standard network tool section (same as nmap)

Use double-dash `--` for list descriptions. Keep each skill under 50 lines.

  <files>.claude/skills/netcat/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/traceroute/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create SKILL.md for netcat and traceroute following the exact validated pattern.

**netcat** (`.claude/skills/netcat/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: netcat, description: "TCP/UDP networking swiss-army knife using netcat wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Netcat Network Utility"
- Purpose line: "Run netcat wrapper scripts for port scanning, listeners, and file transfers with educational examples."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Port Scanning**: `bash scripts/netcat/scan-ports.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Scan ports using nc -z mode with variant-aware flags
  - **Listeners**: `bash scripts/netcat/setup-listener.sh [port] [-j] [-x]` -- Set up listeners for reverse shells, file transfers, and debugging
  - **File Transfer**: `bash scripts/netcat/transfer-files.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Send and receive files, directories, and compressed data over TCP
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/netcat/examples.sh <target>` -- View 10 common netcat patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: scan-ports and transfer-files default to `127.0.0.1` when no target provided; setup-listener defaults to port `4444` when no port provided; Detects nc variant (ncat, GNU, traditional, OpenBSD) and labels variant-specific flags; Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation: standard network tool section (same as nmap)

NOTE: Arguments vary by script -- scan-ports takes [target], setup-listener takes [port], transfer-files takes [target]. Document each accurately.

**traceroute** (`.claude/skills/traceroute/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: traceroute, description: "Network path tracing and latency diagnosis using traceroute and mtr wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Traceroute Path Analyzer"
- Purpose line: "Run traceroute wrapper scripts for network path tracing, route comparison, and latency diagnosis."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Path Tracing**: `bash scripts/traceroute/trace-network-path.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Trace network path to target showing each hop and latency
  - **Route Comparison**: `bash scripts/traceroute/compare-routes.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Compare TCP, UDP, and ICMP route paths to detect filtering
  - **Latency Diagnosis**: `bash scripts/traceroute/diagnose-latency.sh [target] [-j] [-x]` -- Diagnose network latency issues using mtr real-time analysis
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/traceroute/examples.sh <target>` -- View 10 common traceroute patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: Target defaults to `example.com` when not provided; diagnose-latency requires `mtr` (not traceroute) -- install separately if needed; Requires sudo on macOS for raw socket access; Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation: standard network tool section (same as nmap)

Use double-dash `--` for list descriptions. Keep each skill under 55 lines.
