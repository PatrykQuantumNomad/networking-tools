<objective>
Create Claude Code skill files for the 4 offline/file-based pentesting tools: hashcat, john, aircrack-ng, and foremost.

Purpose: These tools operate on local files (hash files, archives, disk images, wireless captures) rather than network targets. They share a modified Target Validation section that notes no network scope validation is needed. Grouping them together reduces context-switching on this distinction.

Output: 4 SKILL.md files in `.claude/skills/{hashcat,john,aircrack-ng,foremost}/SKILL.md`

  <action>
Create SKILL.md for hashcat and john following the exact validated pattern from `.claude/skills/nmap/SKILL.md`.

**hashcat** (`.claude/skills/hashcat/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: hashcat, description: "GPU-accelerated password hash cracking using hashcat wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Hashcat Password Cracker"
- Purpose line: "Run hashcat wrapper scripts for GPU-accelerated hash cracking with educational examples and structured JSON output."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **GPU Performance**: `bash scripts/hashcat/benchmark-gpu.sh [-j] [-x]` -- Benchmark GPU hash cracking speed across common hash types (NO argument -- benchmarks hardware)
  - **NTLM Cracking**: `bash scripts/hashcat/crack-ntlm-hashes.sh [hashfile] [-j] [-x]` -- Crack Windows NTLM hashes using dictionary, brute force, and rule-based attacks
  - **Web Hash Cracking**: `bash scripts/hashcat/crack-web-hashes.sh [hashfile] [-j] [-x]` -- Crack MD5, SHA-256, bcrypt, WordPress, Django, and MySQL hashes
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/hashcat/examples.sh` -- View 10 common hashcat patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical to nmap skill (verbatim copy)
- Defaults: Hash file argument is optional (scripts show techniques without a file when omitted); Benchmark runs against common hash types (MD5, SHA-256, NTLM, bcrypt); Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation (modified for offline tool): "All scripts validate commands via the PreToolUse hook. If commands are blocked: 1. Run `/netsec-health` to check safety architecture status 2. Hashcat operates on local files -- no network scope validation required"

**john** (`.claude/skills/john/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: john, description: "Password hash cracking and identification using John the Ripper wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "John the Ripper"
- Purpose line: "Run John the Ripper wrapper scripts for password cracking, hash identification, and educational examples."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Linux Passwords**: `bash scripts/john/crack-linux-passwords.sh [-j] [-x]` -- Crack /etc/shadow hashes using wordlists, rules, and incremental modes (NO positional argument)
  - **Archive Cracking**: `bash scripts/john/crack-archive-passwords.sh [archive] [-j] [-x]` -- Crack password-protected ZIP, RAR, 7z, and PDF files
  - **Hash Identification**: `bash scripts/john/identify-hash-type.sh [hash] [-j] [-x]` -- Identify unknown hash types using john's format detection and hash-identifier
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/john/examples.sh` -- View 10 common John the Ripper patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: Arguments vary by script (archive file, hash string, or none for linux-passwords); John requires PATH setup (scripts handle via setup_john_path internally); Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation (modified for offline tool): same pattern as hashcat -- operates on local files, no network scope validation required

Use double-dash `--` for list descriptions (project style). Keep each skill under 55 lines.

  <files>.claude/skills/aircrack-ng/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/foremost/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Create SKILL.md for aircrack-ng and foremost following the exact validated pattern.

**aircrack-ng** (`.claude/skills/aircrack-ng/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: aircrack-ng, description: "WiFi security auditing and WPA cracking using aircrack-ng wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Aircrack-ng WiFi Security Suite"
- Purpose line: "Run aircrack-ng wrapper scripts for wireless network analysis, handshake capture, and WPA cracking."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **Wireless Analysis**: `bash scripts/aircrack-ng/analyze-wireless-networks.sh [interface] [-j] [-x]` -- Survey nearby networks for encryption types, signal strength, and hidden SSIDs
  - **Handshake Capture**: `bash scripts/aircrack-ng/capture-handshake.sh [interface] [-j] [-x]` -- Capture WPA/WPA2 4-way handshake for offline cracking
  - **WPA Cracking**: `bash scripts/aircrack-ng/crack-wpa-handshake.sh [capture.cap] [-j] [-x]` -- Crack captured handshake using dictionary attacks
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/aircrack-ng/examples.sh` -- View 10 common aircrack-ng patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: Interface defaults to `wlan0` when not provided (analysis and capture scripts); Crack script accepts a `.cap` file path as first argument; Linux only -- monitor mode commands (airmon-ng, airodump-ng) are not available on macOS; On macOS, scripts show commands as reference only; Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation (modified for wireless tool): "All scripts validate commands via the PreToolUse hook. If commands are blocked: 1. Run `/netsec-health` to check safety architecture status 2. Wireless tools operate on local interfaces -- network scope validation applies to target BSSIDs"

**foremost** (`.claude/skills/foremost/SKILL.md`):
- Frontmatter: name: foremost, description: "File carving and forensic data recovery using foremost wrapper scripts", disable-model-invocation: true
- H1: "Foremost File Carver"
- Purpose line: "Run foremost wrapper scripts for recovering deleted files, carving specific file types, and analyzing forensic disk images."
- Available Scripts categories:
  - **File Recovery**: `bash scripts/foremost/recover-deleted-files.sh [disk-image] [-j] [-x]` -- Recover deleted files from disk images using header/footer signatures
  - **Targeted Carving**: `bash scripts/foremost/carve-specific-filetypes.sh [disk-image] [-j] [-x]` -- Carve specific file types (jpg, pdf, doc, zip) from disk images
  - **Forensic Analysis**: `bash scripts/foremost/analyze-forensic-image.sh [evidence-image] [-j] [-x]` -- Analyze forensic evidence images for recoverable artifacts
  - **Learning Mode**: `bash scripts/foremost/examples.sh [disk-image]` -- View 10 common foremost patterns with explanations
- Flags section: identical verbatim
- Defaults: Disk image argument is optional (scripts show techniques when omitted); Output goes to a timestamped directory by default; Scripts display commands without running them unless `-x` is passed
- Target Validation (modified for offline tool): same pattern as hashcat -- operates on local disk images, no network scope validation required
