<objective>
Redesign the homepage into a compelling entry point that showcases the full toolkit with a branded hero, feature highlights, categorized tool grids, and guide links.

Purpose: The current homepage is a minimal splash page with a generic tagline and a markdown feature list. The redesign transforms it into a structured landing page that helps visitors immediately understand the project scope and navigate to what they need.
Output: Rewritten `index.mdx` with Starlight Card/CardGrid/LinkCard components, plus homepage-specific CSS in `custom.css`.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Convert homepage to MDX and build full landing page content</name>
  <files>site/src/content/docs/index.mdx</files>
  <action>
Rename `site/src/content/docs/index.md` to `site/src/content/docs/index.mdx` (use `git mv` to preserve history).

Rewrite the file with the following structure:

**Frontmatter:**
- Keep `title: Networking Tools`, `description`, and `template: splash`
- Add hero image with dark/light variants: `dark: ../../assets/logo-dark.svg`, `light: ../../assets/logo-light.svg`, `alt: "Networking Tools terminal prompt logo"`
- Replace the verbose tagline with a punchy one: "Pentesting scripts and diagnostics. Ready to run."
- Keep the two action buttons but update the Get Started link to `/networking-tools/guides/getting-started/` (more specific than `/networking-tools/guides/`)

**Import statement** (after frontmatter closing `---`):
```
import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
```

**Section 1: "At a Glance"** -- 4 feature highlight Cards in a CardGrid:
1. `icon="setting"` title="17 Tools" -- "From nmap to aircrack-ng -- scanning, packet analysis, password cracking, web fuzzing, and more."
2. `icon="document"` title="28 Use-Case Scripts" -- "Task-focused scripts for common pentest scenarios. Run one command, get what you need."
3. `icon="laptop"` title="Docker Lab" -- "DVWA, Juice Shop, WebGoat, and VulnerableApp for safe, legal practice."
4. `icon="information"` title="Diagnostics" -- "Auto-report scripts for DNS, connectivity, and performance troubleshooting."

**Section 2: "Security Tools"** -- 13 LinkCards in a CardGrid. Use SHORT descriptions (not the full frontmatter descriptions). Each LinkCard needs `href` with `/networking-tools/` base path prefix. Order them as:
1. Nmap -- "Network scanning and host discovery"
2. TShark -- "CLI packet capture and analysis"
3. Metasploit -- "Penetration testing framework"
4. Hashcat -- "GPU-accelerated password cracking"
5. John the Ripper -- "Versatile password cracker"
6. SQLMap -- "Automatic SQL injection testing"
7. Nikto -- "Web server vulnerability scanner"
8. hping3 -- "Packet crafting and network probing"
9. Aircrack-ng -- "WiFi security auditing suite"
10. Skipfish -- "Web application security scanner"
11. Foremost -- "File carving and data recovery"
12. ffuf -- "Fast web fuzzer"
13. Gobuster -- "Web content and DNS discovery"

Note: 13 is odd, so the last card will span one column. This is acceptable per research findings.

**Section 3: "Networking Tools"** -- 4 LinkCards in a CardGrid:
1. curl -- "HTTP requests and endpoint testing"
2. dig -- "DNS record lookups and tracing"
3. Netcat -- "Network Swiss Army knife"
4. Traceroute -- "Route tracing and latency analysis"

**Section 4: "Diagnostics"** -- 3 LinkCards in a CardGrid:
1. DNS Diagnostic -- "Comprehensive DNS troubleshooting report"
2. Connectivity Diagnostic -- "Layer-by-layer connectivity check from DNS to TLS"
3. Performance Diagnostic -- "Hop-by-hop latency analysis with traceroute and mtr"

Hrefs use `/networking-tools/diagnostics/{slug}/` pattern.

**Section 5: "Guides & Learning Paths"** -- 6 LinkCards in a CardGrid:
1. Getting Started -- "Install tools, verify setup, and start the lab"
2. Lab Walkthrough -- "Guided pentest engagement against Docker targets"
3. "I Want To..." -- "Find the right tool by task"
4. "Reconnaissance" -- "Learning path: dig, nmap, tshark, metasploit"
5. "Web App Testing" -- "Learning path: nmap, nikto, skipfish, sqlmap"
6. "Network Debugging" -- "Learning path: dig, traceroute, hping3, curl, tshark"

Hrefs use `/networking-tools/guides/{slug}/` pattern.

Do NOT include the old markdown content (What is this, Quick Start, Features sections). The new component-based layout replaces all of it.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /Users/patrykattc/work/git/networking-tools/site && npx astro build` -- build must succeed with 0 errors. Verify the old `index.md` no longer exists and `index.mdx` is in its place.</verify>
  <done>Homepage file is `index.mdx` with hero (logo + tagline), 4 feature Cards, 13 security tool LinkCards, 4 networking tool LinkCards, 3 diagnostic LinkCards, and 6 guide LinkCards. Build passes.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add homepage section spacing CSS and verify full build</name>
  <files>site/src/styles/custom.css</files>
  <action>
Append to the existing `site/src/styles/custom.css` (do NOT modify the existing dark/light mode accent overrides) a new section for homepage styling:

```css
/* ============================================================
 * HOMEPAGE SECTION SPACING
 * Targets splash pages with a hero section.
 * [data-has-hero] is set on <html> by Starlight when a page
 * has hero frontmatter (verified from Page.astro).
 * ============================================================ */
[data-has-hero] .sl-markdown-content h2 {
	margin-top: 2rem;
	padding-top: 1.5rem;
	border-top: 1px solid var(--sl-color-hairline-light);
}

/* Remove border from first section heading (directly after hero) */
[data-has-hero] .sl-markdown-content h2:first-child {
	border-top: none;
	margin-top: 0;
}
```

After adding CSS, run a full build to confirm:
1. Build succeeds with 0 errors
2. Page count is correct (should be 31 pages -- same as before since we renamed, not added)

Do NOT add any other CSS. The Card, CardGrid, and LinkCard components handle their own styling through Starlight's design system.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `cd /Users/patrykattc/work/git/networking-tools/site && npx astro build` -- build succeeds. Grep `custom.css` for `[data-has-hero]` to confirm the CSS was added.</verify>
  <done>Homepage sections have visual separators between categories. Full site build passes cleanly. No regressions in existing pages.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `site/src/content/docs/index.mdx` exists (not `.md`)
2. `index.mdx` imports Card, CardGrid, LinkCard from Starlight
3. Hero frontmatter has `image.dark` and `image.light` pointing to logo SVGs
4. All 17 tool LinkCards present with correct `/networking-tools/tools/{slug}/` hrefs
5. All 3 diagnostic LinkCards present with correct `/networking-tools/diagnostics/{slug}/` hrefs
6. All 6 guide LinkCards present with correct `/networking-tools/guides/{slug}/` hrefs
7. 4 feature highlight Cards present in "At a Glance" section
8. `custom.css` contains `[data-has-hero]` section spacing rules
9. `npx astro build` succeeds with 0 errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Homepage renders a branded hero with project logo, a "At a Glance" feature overview, categorized tool/diagnostic/guide card grids with working links, and clean section separators. The full site builds without errors.
